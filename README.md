### E-Prescriptions Project

Welcome to the E-Prescriptions project repository! This project was developed during our University Group project and aims to streamline the prescription process by transitioning from traditional paper-based methods to a secure, efficient, and user-friendly electronic system. This README will provide an overview of the project, including details about the frontend and backend components.

## Overview

The E-Prescriptions project is designed to enhance medication management for healthcare providers, pharmacists, and patients. The system consists of two main components: the frontend and the backend.

## Frontend

The frontend is the user-facing part of the application, providing an intuitive and accessible interface for healthcare providers, pharmacists, and patients.

### Key Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration for different user roles (healthcare providers, pharmacists, patients).
- **Prescription Management:** Easy creation, viewing, and management of electronic prescriptions.
- **Patient Portal:** Patients can view their prescriptions, receive notifications, and manage refills.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures accessibility across various devices (desktops, tablets, smartphones).

### Technologies Used

- **React:** For building the user interface.
- **Redux:** For state management.
- **NHS Styles:** For consistent and visually appealing design components following NHS standards.
- **Axios:** For making HTTP requests to the backend.

## Backend

The backend is the server-side part of the application, handling the business logic, data storage, and communication with the frontend.

### Key Features

- **User Management:** Handles user registration, authentication, and authorization.
- **Prescription Processing:** Manages the creation, storage, and retrieval of electronic prescriptions.
- **Secure Data Storage:** Ensures the secure storage of sensitive patient and prescription data.
- **API Integration:** Provides RESTful APIs for communication with the frontend.

### Technologies Used

- **Django:** For building the backend application.
- **Django REST Framework:** For creating RESTful APIs.
- **PostgreSQL:** For the database to store user and prescription data.
- **JWT:** For secure authentication and authorization.
